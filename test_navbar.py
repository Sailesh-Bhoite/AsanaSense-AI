        ### Project Goal
        Our aim is to create an interactive web application that uses AI to analyze
        and provide feedback on yoga poses in real-time.

        ### Technologies Used
        * **Streamlit 1.47:** For the interactive web interface and deployment.
        * **MediaPipe:** For robust pose estimation.
        * **OpenCV:** For video processing.
        * **Python 3.10:** The core language.

        Stay tuned for more updates!
